This GCN implementation tries to handle graph-classification tasks in two (similar) ways:

1. "global node" approach - for each graph, a global node is added, only global nodes are classified
2. global mean pooling approacah - added a mean-pooling layer as the last layer (before softmax) in GCN

Both approaches start with a sparse, block-diagonal version of an adjacency matrix that gathers all the graphs in the dataset.
See https://github.com/tkipf/gcn/issues/4#issuecomment-274445114  for a better explanation - with figures

Results: on Protein dataset -with the settings in the code- i obtain an average accuracy of 78.8% with 2.7% as standard deviation.
The result is an average of 100 results, of tests conducted using 1000 graphs in the training set and 100 in the test set.
